About me ðŸ‘‹


**dmachemer/dmachemer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I am a Computing teacher at St. Julian's School in Portugal
- I am currently learning how best to use GitHub for my Computer Science classes
- I would lile to increase the collaboartion with my students
- Fun fact: I like flying drones!
